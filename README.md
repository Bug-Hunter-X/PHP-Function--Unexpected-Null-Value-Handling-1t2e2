# PHP Function: Unexpected Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP functions: improper handling of null values.  The `my_function` initially lacks robust null checks, leading to potential issues. The solution provides improved null handling.

## Bug

The original `my_function` does not explicitly handle cases where `$a` or `$b` is null. This can lead to errors, especially if the function performs operations that are undefined for null values (like arithmetic or string concatenation).

## Solution

The improved `my_function` includes explicit checks for null values at the beginning. If either `$a` or `$b` is null, the function immediately returns `null`, preventing unexpected errors.
